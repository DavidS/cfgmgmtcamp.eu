My name is Mihaela Drumeva, Micky for short and my passion is all things automation!
If I need to perform a task more than twice,
I want to automate it. My 6 year career has spanned 3 companies and over 6 diverse teams,
from development to test, build and infrastructure.  
As well as my day job as an operations engineer my main area of interest is in enhancing and
automating new and exiting processes to increase productivity, confidence and quality.  
  
I recently organised Devopsdays Edinburgh and I'm passionate about building strong and diverse tech communities.
