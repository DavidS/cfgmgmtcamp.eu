Charity is a co-founder and engineer at Honeycomb.io,
a startup that blends the speed of time series with the raw power of rich events to give you interactive,
iterative debugging of complex systems. She has worked at companies like Facebook, Parse, and Linden Lab,
as a systems engineer and engineering manager, but always seems to end up responsible for the databases too.
She loves free speech, free software and a nice peaty single malt.
