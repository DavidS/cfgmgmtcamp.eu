In the more and more prevalent Agile methodology for software development,
velocity and frequent code deployments are king.  
That means frequent deploys and the need to make that happen mostly automatically.  
Rollbacks are mandatory. Everything should be automated, streamlined and audited.  
Today i will show you one way to do a blue/green deploymnet allowing high velocity and flexibility.  
If demo Gods allow it we will even see it in action.
