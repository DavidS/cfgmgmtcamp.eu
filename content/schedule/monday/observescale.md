This is a talk about how Criteo (http://labs.criteo.com/) is monitoring 30k servers across 8 datacenters.  
I'll also talk about observability and what it means and how you should focus on observability
rather than monitoring Technologies would include prometheus, bigGraphite, cassandra and elasticsearch.
