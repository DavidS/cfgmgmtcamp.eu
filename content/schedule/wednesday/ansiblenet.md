This tutorial is a guided session on using Ansible for network device management.  
It will showcase how we use a DevOps based tool, traditionally used for system config management, and leverage it to control network devices.  


By the end of the tutorial, we will showcase how to :

- Make changes to network devices in real time
- Backup network device configurations
- Move a network device config source of truth off the device into an SCM
