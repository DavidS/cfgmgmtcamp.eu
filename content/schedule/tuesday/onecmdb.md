Over the years the topic of CMDBs, asset management and inventoring things have crossed my path numerous times.  

I want to give an overview of the current state of affairs:
What exists in the CMDB landscape within the scope of open source solutions and
why companies still write a lot of these solutions themselves to tackle their specific needs.  
Furthermore I want to elaborate on what I think is actually needed when looking at the subject of asset management and
when there is actually a need for a CMDB.
